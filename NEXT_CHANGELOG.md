## What's new?

* REST API: Products can now be filtered to include `include_types` or exclude `exclude_types` by multiple types simultaneously using the new parameters. Note: `include_types` takes precedence over `type` parameter should both be used.
* REST API: Products can now be filtered to return virtual products by the boolean `virtual` parameter.
* REST API: Products can now be filtered to return only products by brand names using the `brand` parameter.
* REST API: Products now returns any applicable brands. (API v2 Only)
* REST API: Products now returns the global unique id. (API v2 Only)
* REST API: New endpoint `cocart/v2/products/brands` to get product brands like categories.
* REST API: New endpoint `cocart/v2/products/reviews/mine` to return product reviews only by the current user. Requires authentication.
* REST API: Product variations in cart can now be updated using the same update item endpoint `cocart/v2/cart/item/{item_key}`.
* REST API: New POST method for the cart to create an empty cart for guest customers.

> Developer note: Cart creation is normally done the moment the first item is added to the cart as it has something to save to session. But some users are confused with creating a cart for guest customers. This route can help create an empty cart, storing just the cart key and return it in the response. See the quick start guide in the documentation for more information on how to use the cart key for a guest customer.

* Plugin: New WP-CLI command `wp cocart status` shows the status of carts in session.
* Plugin: New WP-CLI command `wp cocart sessions` shows the details of each session and allows you to check if they exist.
* Plugin: Updates are provided from us for all supported CoCart plugins.
* Plugin: Will deactivate legacy core version if one found installed and active. If you try to activate legacy version while the new core version is active it will deactivate. Recommend deleting.

> Developer note: If you have the `COCART_REMOVE_ALL_DATA` constant set to true. Recommend setting it to false before uninstalling the legacy version from your WordPress dashboard to prevent any issues.

* Plugin: Integrity check of all files.

> Developer note: Know if the version of CoCart is official and has not been tampered with. This is just the first iteration introduced.
> You will never see the warning messages if all is in order, but if you do alter any files within the plugin yourself directly. You will be notified in your WordPress dashboard and in your error log that something has changed and does not match.

## Breaking Changes

* REST API: Avatars only return if requested now when using the login endpoint.
* REST API: Store API now returns array of CoCart versions installed not just the core version.
* REST API: Product meta will not return by default. To improve security and prevent PII from exposure, meta must now be whitelisted instead using the new filter `cocart_products_allowed_meta_keys`.
* REST API: The quantity parameter when adding an item now accepts both a `numeric` or an `array` value allowing to extend support for other product types that are a container of other grouped products.
* REST API: When updating an item in cart, the quantity parameter is no longer required. Allowing to change just the variation of a variable product to keep the current quantity already requested.
* REST API: Product Categories changed `image_src` from a single thumbnail to return all image sizes available. Schema updated to match.
* REST API: Product reviews was updated to support better query parameters. Affects both API versions. Schema updated to match.
* REST API: The response class `CoCart_Response` is deprecated. New utility response classes have been created for better utilization.
* Feature: Load Cart from Session rewritten. See details below.
* Plugin: Text domain a.k.a the plugin slug, has changed from `cart-rest-api-for-woocommerce` to `cocart-core`. This affects any translations including custom. If you did a custom translation you will need to rename the text domain to match.

The following returned headers have also been renamed. Better for security reasons.

| Previous Header            | New Header           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| CoCart-API-Cart-Key        | Cart-Key             |
| CoCart-Timestamp           | Timestamp            |
| CoCart-API-Cart-Expiring   | Cart-Expiring        |
| CoCart-API-Cart-Expiration | Cart-Expiration      |

## Changes

* REST API: The main cart controller `CoCart_REST_Cart_V2_Controller` for API v2 now extends a new abstract controller `CoCart_REST_Cart_Controller` for the cart which also extends the core `WP_REST_Controller` of WordPress.

> Developer note: This allows to better extend the cart API rather than the whole cart controller.

* REST API: The following endpoints for Cart API v2: `cart/add-item`, `cart/add-items`, `cart/calculate` now extend `CoCart_REST_Cart_V2_Controller` instead of the Cart API v1 controller.

> Developer note: This allows us to deprecate API v1 in the future. Still working on disconnecting Products API v2 from v1.

* REST API: New product reviews posted are set to status `hold` by default.
* WordPress Dashboard: Style adjustments.

## Improvements

* REST API: Only registers CoCart endpoints if requesting it. Helps performance in backend such as when using Gutenberg/Block editor as it loads many API's in the background.
* REST API: Now hides routes from the index of controllers and returns as an error for added security.
* REST API: Registering the endpoints have been improved and also allows the namespace to register with your own brand (so long as you have the whitelabel add-on installed).
* REST API: Moved more functions and filters to utility class to help improve the complexity of the cart controller so we get better performance.
* REST API: Prevent having to check cart validity, stock and coupons on most cart endpoints other than when getting the cart to help with performance.
* REST API: Optimized how many times we calculate the totals when adding items to the cart to help with performance.
* REST API: Optimized shipping data, added validation and support for recurring carts for subscriptions.
* REST API: Fallback to a wildcard if the origin has yet to be determined for CORS.
* REST API: Override sale and regular price too so the set price is what is shown even if there prices are originally lower.
* Feature: Load cart from session now supports registered customers.
* Localization: Similar messages are now consistent with each other.
* Plugin: We now manage cache related calls under our own cache helper utility to not conflict with any WooCommerce cache calls happening in the background.
* WordPress Dashboard: CoCart is prevented from running in the backend should the REST API server be called by another plugin.

## Third Party Support

* Plugin: LiteSpeed Cache will now exclude CoCart from being cached.

### Load Cart from Session

Originally only designed for guest customers to allow them to checkout via the native site, registered customers can now auto login and load their carts to do the same without exposing login details.

#### How does a registered customer load in without authenticating?

To help customers skip the process of having to login again, we use two data points to validate with that can only be accessed if the user was logged in via the REST API to begin with. This then allows the WordPress site setup as though they had gone through the login process and loads their shopping cart.

The two data points required are the cart key which for the customer logged in via the REST API will be their user ID and the cart hash which represents the last data change of the cart. By using the two together, the customer is able to transfer from the headless version of the store to the native store.

Simply provide these two parameters with the data point values on any page and that's it.

`https://your.store/?cocart-load-cart={cart_key}&c_hash={cart_hash}`

> Developer note: By default, both the cart and checkout pages are still accessible to support the feature "Load cart from Session".
