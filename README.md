#### What is WooCommerce?

WooCommerce is a free open-source eCommerce plugin that provides a **flexible, and efficient** way to build cutting-edge stores with WordPress at it's core.

#### Why do I need CoCart?

If you are looking to create a great store for your customers that is fast and unrestricted, decoupling your store is a no-brainer. However, accessing the front side via the REST API is not designed in WooCommerce, that's where CoCart comes in. It handles the roadblocks and eliminates the hassle of creating your own REST API endpoints and provides all the essential features for a powerful, headless eCommerce experience.

#### Features

* **Source of Truth** - CoCart integrates with WooCommerce's Data Stores API and includes WooCommerce hooks, making it compatible with most WooCommerce extensions right out of the box.
* **Session Control Without Cookies** - CoCart uses a secure session key system, reducing server load and avoiding cookie issues for a smoother experience.
* **Easy Authentication** - No need for Admin API Keys ‚Äî customers can log in multiple ways with options like username+password, email+password or phone number+password.
* **Flexible Domain Control** - CORS problems? No worries. CoCart lets you control origin access to prevent cross-domain issues.
* **Efficient Product Search** - Search by product name, ID or SKU, filter products quickly without compromising privacy.
* **Real-Time Cart Validation** - Enjoy up-to-date cart accuracy with automatic stock checks, total calculations, and fee adjustments.
* **No Headless Checkout?** - Easily load any cart session into the native WooCommerce checkout (if you prefer) and auto-login customers without further user interaction.
* **Customizable Callbacks** - Register your own cart callbacks without creating new endpoints. CoCart handles the rest, returning responses once complete.
* **Cart Session Tracking** - Monitor all cart sessions, including expired or expiring carts, to better track customer engagement.
* **Name Your Price** - Offer customers the option to pay what they want, encourage your audience and increasing conversion rates.
* **Bulk Requests** - Batch multiple cart requests at once for efficiency and faster responses.

And this is just the start. With CoCart, your WooCommerce store can be faster, more flexible, and ready to take on any custom solution you dream up.

## Testimonials

> An excellent plugin, which makes building a headless WooCommerce experience a breeze. Easy to use, nearly zero setup time.
>
> Harald Schneider ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

> What can I say this thing has it all. It is the ‚ÄúMissing WooCommerce REST API plugin‚Äù without it I was managing users cart myself in weird and wonderful but hacky ways. NOT GOOD and so vulnerable. Then I stumbled upon CoCart and with the help of Seb I got it working how I needed it and he has been supporting me with even the smallest of queries. Really appreciate your work and continued support Seb.

> **[Joel Pierre](https://github.com/joelpierre)** ‚Äì JPPdesigns Web design & Development ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

> This plugin was critical to achieve my project of building a headless / decoupled WooCommerce store. I wanted to provide my clients with a CMS to manage their store, but wanted to build the front-end in React. I was able to fetch content over the WooCommerce REST API, but otherwise would not have been able to fetch the cart, and add & remove items if not for this plugin.
>
> Thank you very much S√©bastien for sharing this extension, you‚Äôve saved me a lot of time.
>
> **Allan Pooley** ‚Äì Little and Big ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

> Thanks for doing such a great work with this! Works exactly as expected and CoCart seems to have a nice community around it. The founder seems really devoted and that‚Äôs one of the key things for a plugin like this to live on and get the right updates in the future. We just got ourselves the lifetime subscription.
